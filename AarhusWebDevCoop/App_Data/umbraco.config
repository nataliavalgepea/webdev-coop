        <articleContents><![CDATA[<h3>Teaching Methods</h3>
<p>You are expected to work independently as a large part of the curriculum is learned via work in study groups. The study requires you to take responsibility for your own learning and to commit and involve yourself in your learning as well as the social environment.</p>
<h3>Internship</h3>
<p>You will spend the first half of the 3rd semester in an <a href="http://www.baaa.dk/about-us/get-a-student-as-an-intern/web-development-intern/" title="Web Development">internship</a> with a company. The internship will give you the opportunity to apply your theoretical knowledge to practical work, and at the same time you enhance your chances of gaining quick access to an exciting job. It is your own responsibility to find a company that will take you in, but we will place a large number of contacts at your disposal.</p>
<h3>Bachelor's project</h3>
<p>During the second half of the 3rd semester, you have to write your Bachelor's project. The Bachelor's project should be based on a practice-related issue. You must outline the issue for your Bachelor's project in collaboration with an external partner, e.g. the company where you do your internship. Normally, the project is elaborated on in close contact with the company, and you will probably spend most of your time at the company whilst working on the project.</p>]]></articleContents>

        <projectContents><![CDATA[<p><strong>Hand-in</strong></p>
<p><br />The hand-in must include two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>An describing report that explains the thoughts behind design of frontend and backend solutions. The report must be uploaded as PDF document.</li>
<li>Programmed solution that can be opened and tested in webstorm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hand-in must take place, latest Friday 7. Oktober 2016</p>
<p><br /><strong>Evaluation criterea</strong><br />To pass the course his hand-in has to be accepted by an evaluation that will test if frontend and backend technologies has been used as teached in the course. Evalution will focus on checking if:</p>
<ul>
<li>the design of the solution is feasible</li>
<li>frontend is simpel and flexible to cover all requirements</li>
<li>instant backend-frontend communication is established</li>
<li>NodeJS backend application offers a sufficient API to the client</li>
<li>Mongo backend database contains all data and is organized to improve read performance</li>
</ul>
<p>It is allowed to work in groups. However, all group members must hand in separate reports and programmed solutions. Hand-in of pure copies among group members is not acceptable.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Chat application functionality</strong></p>
<p><br />Login process<br />On the welcome screen users register themselves by typing unique usernames. Then, hereafter the user enters the chat applications main screen.<br />Chat room selection<br />On the main screen a user can create a new or select an existing chat room from a global chat room list. Then all messages inside that chat room appears in a messages list that is loaded from the database. The author is noted next to each chat message.<br />Chat messages<br />Users have a field in which additional messages can be entered. When a message is entered it will immediately be stored in the database and pushed to all users looking at the same chat room. </p>
<p><strong>Technology</strong></p>
<p><br />Architecture<br />The application must consist of a frontend and a backend solution. The frontend is a website that for convenience is build using Pug template engine. The backend is a NodeJS application that uses Express and MongoDB.</p>
<p>Database<br />The chat application must support 3 entities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users</li>
<li>Chat rooms</li>
<li>Chat messages</li>
</ul>
<p><br />Users, chat rooms and chat messages are stored automatically in the backend database.</p>
<p><strong>Process guideline</strong></p>
<p><br />Steps needed to solve the task would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design the document based NoSQL database</li>
<li>Design backend service methods API</li>
<li>Design frontend user interface</li>
<li>Document the design in your report</li>
<li>Program database by using Mongoose</li>
<li>Program Express routing to implement the backend service methods</li>
<li>Program instant frontend-backend message connection.</li>
<li>Use either HTTP-polling or WebSocket technology</li>
<li>Program frontend web pages</li>
<li>Document the programmed solutions in your report</li>
<li>Hand-in your report and programmed solution</li>
</ul>
<p>During the process you can get supervision from the teacher.</p>]]></projectContents>

        <projectContents><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project should be a Umbraco solution for the Aarhus Web Developers Network and must include the following areas:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>About page</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (3 columns grid layout must be used!) with 3 sections (vision, people, skills) with  info on the network.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Home Section</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - you decide what to include, but there should be a list of the two newest projects at least included on this page.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Article Section</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and of course some articles created.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Project Section</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (info about projects, status, list of project sorted by date - newest first) and some projects in the content. The project list should only be viewable by </span><strong>active</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> members, if you are a prospect member, you should get shown a “forbidden access” page. If you are not logged in, you should be referred to the login form.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Contact Section</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a form that must be interactive and save new comments in Umbraco backoffice(creating new contents) (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to send email is optional)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">). There must be server side validation included in the contact form (i.e. fields should not be empty, this should give a message to the user and the email should be checked (this can easily be done!))</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Member Section</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - with a list of all the members (the list </span><strong>should only</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be viewable if you are a member that</span><strong> is logged in</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">). You should have two member groups (active and prospect). You must show membership photos of active members.</span></li>
<li><strong>Message board section</strong> - <span style="font-weight: 400;">here it should be possible to post messages that will be shown on this page giving two inputs (a name and a message). You can see one of the week plans for this exercise. You </span><strong>MUST put access restriction</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on this page, so that only members (both active and prospects) can post messages. </span></li>
<li><strong>Login Section</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a form where members can log in and </span>there must also<span style="font-weight: 400;"> be an option to logout.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>A project drop-down menu</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where each project can be selected (see the navigation bar below). ONLY completed projects should be shown in the drop down and not all projects.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>A navigational bar</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from where all areas are easily accessed. With bootstrap it could look something like the image here (message board not shown in this menu - but you should include in the main menu):</span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>You should style the solution to make it look nice and include some “real” mockup content to make the site look realistic - IF I SEE LORUM IPSUM OR SIMILAR I WILL NOT APPROVE YOUR SOLUTION!</strong><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Your solution will judged on the following parameters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much of the above functionality is implemented and works</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Niceness” of the solution (styling, UX, etc).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">code quality</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">your ability to put in mockup data and not lorum ipsum.</span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>It will be judged as passed or failed. You need to pass this in order to go to the exam.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hand-in on Fronter:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> a .zip file with ALL FILES in your project folder (this includes the database also) and the github link as well. A “project.txt” file should be included in the zip with info about the login/password to your Umbraco Backend </span><strong>AND login/password of one active member AND login/password of one prospect member.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If you use the SQL SERVER database (which you should!) you should also include a copy of your database - see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ON3-GlSr3d20OvTzm9HvSVRvN7DhqnkqD7IaWAZKd_Y/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> how to make a .bacpac file and then include that .bacpac file in your .zip.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>You can (optional) in fact also publish your project to azure (Martynas tells me you can still do it for free without getting the special student accounts) and if you do that, then obviously I do not need the database as this will be on azure - but I still need the code in .zip file and a URL then.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Te_HUinHdpR7csgNvIRB40GbqQ_yvEx8WnzEq1JDacg/edit?usp=sharing">guide for Azure publishing</a> last year for Umbraco - it should still work, but I did not try it again recently.</strong></p>
<p><br /><strong>Deadline:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday 13th October 2016 at 20.00 Danish Time.</span></p>]]></projectContents>

        <projectContents><![CDATA[<p><strong>Description of case:</strong></p>
<p>Squares is a digital gallery for new art, where gallery visitors can fashion and create the final expression of the art pieces. On Squares artists create new artworks that are divided into small digital pieces that visitors can play around with and put together via a digital interface. Squares is an open art playground where you can purchase printed versions of the artists' works reworked into your particular personal design. Squares will be a global, user-driven and interactive gallery where people from around the globe can dive into the artworks and create works that fit their expression and experience. At the same time Squares is a fascinating and imaginative business concept that attracts artists, both because, of the initial challenge to their creativity, and because they can sell and profit from their work. Squares is a new project lunched by KongOrange. KongOrange is a freelance-based development bureau specialising in digital entertainment across multiple platforms (kongorange.com/).</p>
<p><strong>Current idea of how Squares could work:</strong></p>
<p>(You can make improvements and changes)</p>
<p>1. An artist, for example, Kamila, creates five different motives each on a small square piece. Each piece is about the size of a Polaroid photo. The five pieces can be freely put together, to form several different motives. Some artists choose to develop pieces that are figuratively linked, while others make abstract checkers, which allows you to mix the pieces like mosaics etc.</p>
<p>2. Kamila upload her set of five pieces to Squares.</p>
<p>3. You can use Squares to browse sets made by artists from around the world, including Kamilas set. Moreover, you can judge each set and give it a grade.</p>
<p>4. The best user-rated sets will continuously be selected and the artists behind them will get the opportunity to complete a full set of 25 pieces. Kamila is a skilled artist, so she is selected!</p>
<p>5. Kamila develops a full set of 25 pieces including the five original pieces that got good remarks.</p>
<p>6. Kamila names her set FREAKS, because you can combine various freaks. She is paid 10,000 Dkk. upon uploading her full FREAKS set to Squares (see attached mock-up of this set).</p>
<p>7. All other full set, are available for browsing on Squares.</p>
<p>8. You can rearrange and re-imagine all of the full set on Squares on your own digital canvas by rearranging the pieces, to create new compositions.</p>
<p>9. You can share your personally assembled kit on social media. You can also share other users' composition and comment on them if you think it is good and deserves attention.</p>
<p>10. If you really fall in love with one of your personal versions of a set, you can buy them.</p>
<p>11. You can transfer your artwork to different formats: a poster, a framed picture or a t-shirt and get it delivered for a fee.</p>
<p>12. You can also buy the 25 pieces in a set as physical cardboard pieces. Bring them home and make your own combinations on the living room table, or giving a set away as a small present or corporate gift. The artist gets a share of the revenues generated through the sale of the artist's own set.</p>
<p><strong>Group assignment:</strong></p>
<p>The project is to be solved in groups of three or four members.</p>
<p><strong>Hand out and official presentation:</strong></p>
<p>A description of the assignment will be presented Wednesday, May 4th at 11:40. Each study group is required to prepare three questions for the assignment in advance of the official presentation. The official presentation is on Monday, May 9th at 8:30. Esben Kjær Ravn, owner at KongOrange, will hold a presentation, describing the idea behind their Squares project and explaining the development process and your place in it. Expected duration: 45 minutes including questions. The presentation will take place in Auditorium A at the academy. The presentation is in English.</p>
<p><strong>Hand in, Show off and Feedback: </strong></p>
<p>The assignment must be submitted on Tuesday, May 24th at 12:00. The Show off presentations will take place the same day, Tuesday, May 24th at 13:00. Each group is required to hold a five-minute show-off presentation of their solution to the assignment. Esben Kjær Ravn from KongOrange will attend the presentations. This is your opportunity to show Esben how you think the project should work, look and feel in order to be a success. The presentation schedule will be announced at a later date. The feedback session will take place on Friday, May 27th. For the Feedback session, each group will give an 8-minute presentation of their solution. Including their own recommendation for improving their work. This is your chance to show the teachers that you covered all the requirements of the assignment, and have balanced you work effort in a professional and effective way. All teachers will be present and we expect feedback to take about 30 minutes for each group. The feedback schedule will be announced at a later date.</p>
<p><strong>Number of pages: </strong></p>
<p>Task report must contain five pages per group member + five pages. (A group of four members will hand in 25 pages in total)</p>
<p><strong>Material: </strong></p>
<p>The following material provided by Esben at KongOrange, are available on Fronter here: There are no requirements as to how or where you use the material in your project. The material includes:</p>
<p>- A mock-up of a set of pieces. Includes: 38 pieces + 8 named example combinations.</p>
<p>- Personas for target groups, developed at KongOrange.</p>
<p>(KongOrange owns the set of pieces for Squares. This means you do not share or sell it without authorisation from Esben at KongOrange.)</p>]]></projectContents>
